## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
  The point at which a media query is introduced

- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
  Using percentages allows for a consistent interface across different kinds of devices whereas fixed widths could vary in appearance when viewed on different devices.

- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
  The rules defined later in the style sheet have precedence because the style sheet reads CSS rules from top to bottom. Therefore, the bottom rules will "win".
