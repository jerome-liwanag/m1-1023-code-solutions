## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of variables?
  To store data

- How do you **declare** a variable?
  You use the "let" or "const" keyword followed by the variable name. "Var" is also another option.

- How do you initialize (**assign a value to**) a variable?
   We use the assignment operator '=' and assign a value to the variable. For example, if we can assign the value "Jerome" to a variable firstName as such: let name = "Jerome".

- What characters are allowed in variable names?
  Letters, '$', and underscores ('_')

- What does it mean to say that variable names are "case sensitive"?
  A variable can only be acccessed or manipulated by referring to how it was originally spelled. For example, a variable named "name" is not the same as "Name".

- What is the purpose of a string?
  To store and manipulate text

- What is the purpose of a number?
  To work with and/or manipulate double precision floating point numbers such as through performing various mathematic operations

- What is the purpose of a boolean?
  Needed for data types that can only have one of two values (Ex: true/false, yes/no)

- What does the `=` operator mean in JavaScript?
  Assigns a value to a variable

- How do you update the value of a variable?
  You use the assignment operator once again to change the value of the variable but this time without using let, const, or var keywords before the variable name.

- What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?
  'Null' refers to an empty or unknown value, whereas 'undefined' values are associated with variables that are declared but not assigned a value.

- Why is it a good habit to include "labels" when you log values to the browser console?
  It helps when debugging and avoids confusion. By providing labels, we can see what variables or values are being logged to the console.

- Give five examples of JavaScript primitives.
  String, number, boolean, null, undefined
