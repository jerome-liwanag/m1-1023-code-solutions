## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  A function allows reuse of code throughout a program that makes it easier to read as well as help make the program more dynamic.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  A function definition begins with the function keyword followed by an optional name surrounded by parentheses, a comma-separated list of zero or more parameters, the start of the function's code block indicated by an opening curly brace, an optional return statement, and the end of the code block indicated by a closing curly brace.

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  A function call simply involves writing the name of the function and placing parentheses next to it and arguments within the parentheses if needed.

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  A function call actually executes the funciton, whereas the function definition just defines it and states what it can do when executed. Function calls also appear less complex than definitions.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  A parameter holds the value of an argument. When defining a function, we declare parameters and when we call a function, we pass its arguments.

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  Parameters act as a placeholder such that they hold the value of the argument in a function.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  A 'return' statement causes the function to produce a value we can use in our program and prevents any more code in the function's code block from being run.
